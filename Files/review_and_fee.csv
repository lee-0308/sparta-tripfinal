I do not know how people manage to leave after three hours - this art museum is a whole-day-affair and kept me busy for 5.5 hours without checking out the museum shop and the section 1100 to 1600.

But those 5.5 hours were really happy ones and not even the huge crowds could spoil my experience. Do not worry, they only flock together in front of a handful paintings and even then you will find your gap to meet these paintings face to face.
Getting online tickets is the best way to keep waiting time very short and with a tiny bit of patience you will grab a locker within a few minutes. Invest in the audio guide - it is loaded with useful information. Dress lightly because inside it can get quite hot even on a chilly spring day (must be the crowds ??).

The huge museum building covers art from 1100 to 2000. Do not miss the modern art sections on 3rd floor (esp. 1950 to 2000). Finding the access was a bit frustrating, but keep searching for the right lift to take you up there.

The four Vermeer paintings on 2nd floor are superb and were my personal highlight (Milkmaid, Little Street, Love Letter and Woman in Blue) ... and yes, I managed to get close to all of them ... patience is key ??.

Visited yesterday and had an incredible time exploring SEA LIFE Kelly Tarlton’s Aquarium! The entire aquarium is uniquely built underground, which adds a special charm to the visit. There's convenient parking right outside, and inside, you’ll also find a cafeteria offering snacks and drinks for a quick break.

The main highlight for me was definitely the penguins! ?? They have a large number of them, and the setup is amazing?a cold, snowy environment specially designed to suit their natural habitat. It’s so heartwarming to see them playing around, and you get to observe them really up close!

Another standout feature was the moving walkway tunnel?you just hop on and it slowly moves you through an underwater world filled with colorful fish, sharks, and stingrays swimming right above and beside you. It truly gives the sensation of walking under the sea.

You’ll also spot crabs, jellyfish, and other marine creatures, each displayed beautifully. It’s a great place for kids and adults alike to learn and enjoy.

?? Suggestions for Improvement:

The entry fee is a bit expensive, so it might not be ideal for every budget.

I did feel a bit lost in certain areas, so I’d recommend that they provide a map and some guidance on what’s inside at the ticket counter. It would make the visit smoother.

Overall, it was an extraordinary experience and a must-visit attraction in Auckland if you're into marine life.

If you’re ever in Ubud and feel like being mildly judged by monkeys while wandering through an ancient jungle temple?this is the place. It’s officially called the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, but I’m convinced the monkeys are the ones running the place and the humans are just tolerated guests.

The forest itself is absolutely stunning?like walking through a real-life jungle movie set, complete with moss-covered statues, vine-draped trees, and little temple ruins that look like they’ve been frozen in time (in the best, most Instagrammable way). It’s peaceful and wild at the same time.

Now let’s talk monkeys. There are so many of them, and they have zero chill. One climbed up a guy next to me like he was a tree and tried to unzip his backpack. Another one stared at me like it was sizing me up for snacks I didn’t even have. They're bold, clever, and honestly kind of hilarious to watch?just don’t bring food unless you want to get mugged by a furry gang of pickpockets.

The staff is super chill but clearly know what they're doing. They’ll give you the “don’t look them in the eye, don’t touch the baby monkeys” speech, which you should absolutely take seriously. You can totally enjoy them from a respectful distance (and sometimes a not-so-voluntary close one).

Would I go again? Definitely only cos my kids loved it and would want to do it again. Otherwise, the one visit/experience would be enough.

We tried some local food near the temple, and I was pleasantly surprised. The satay was fresh and nicely grilled?very flavorful. However, I didn’t enjoy the peanut sauce as much; I personally prefer the richer, slightly sweeter Malaysian-style version.

I recently visited Tanah Lot Temple in Bali, and it was truly an unforgettable experience. The temple itself is perched on a rock formation in the middle of the sea, creating a dramatic and beautiful sight?especially during high tide when it looks completely surrounded by water.

While visitors aren’t allowed to go inside the temple, the surrounding area is open for exploration and offers absolutely breathtaking views from every angle. The sea breeze, crashing waves, and the silhouette of the temple against the sky make it a photographer's dream.

Many people come here to catch the sunset, which I’ve heard is spectacular. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we couldn’t make it.

The area around the temple is also filled with charming shops selling local crafts, souvenirs, and snacks. It's a great place to pick up some gifts or just enjoy browsing.

During my recent trip to Bangkok, I visited Sea Life Bangkok, located on Basement Level -1 of Siam Paragon Mall. It's a great indoor attraction if you’re looking to escape the heat or enjoy a quiet morning in the city center.

I chose the combo ticket which included:
?? Sea Life Aquarium
?? Madame Tussauds Wax Museum
?? 4D Cinema ? a short but fun animated movie about animals, with moving seats and effects (great for kids!)

The total cost was around 1,700 THB, and while that’s not cheap, the experience was enjoyable overall.

But the real highlight?
Absolutely the Glass Bottom Boat Ride ? a short but magical experience where you float over a massive tank filled with rays, sharks, and colorful fish.
Important: This is NOT included in the standard ticket ? it’s an extra, but honestly worth every baht.
I highly recommend doing it early in the morning when there’s no queue and the atmosphere is calm and quiet. It really made the whole visit more special.

What I liked:

The glass tunnel ? always fascinating to walk through

Penguins, jellyfish, and interactive zones

The 4D cinema adds a fun touch to the visit

Glass Boat: short but totally worth the extra!

What to consider:

The entire aquarium can be visited in 2 to 3 hours

It’s smaller than other aquariums I’ve seen in Italy or Spain, and more expensive

Being inside a shopping mall, space is limited

Final Thoughts:
Sea Life Bangkok is a well-maintained, modern, and fun experience, especially if paired with Madame Tussauds and the 4D movie.
But if you go, don’t miss the Glass Bottom Boat ? it was the best part of the whole visit.

I’ve included the timings for the show that was there the day I went, not sure if it’s the same every day.
If you just want to stroll through you could even finish earlier. They have a lot of different specifies to see and we really enjoyed watching the sharks and 2 types of penguins. You can buy tickets online, they have them every hour. If you buy them in advance, it’s a bit cheaper. You can also buy them in person but you may not get your time slot depending on how busy they are.

Feel free to contact for tips/questions.

This monumental complex, located in the heart of Beijing, is one of the most iconic and historically significant sites in the country.
The Forbidden City is a masterpiece of traditional Chinese architecture. Built during the Ming Dynasty and expanded during the Qing Dynasty, this vast area consists of more than 900 buildings and covers an area of about 720,000 square meters. The buildings are arranged symmetrically along a central axis, with yellow tile roofs, red walls and finely carved wooden details. Each architectural element reflects the art and mastery of the builders of the time.
The main entrance is through the Gate of Heavenly Peace (Tiananmen), which leads to Tiananmen Square, one of the most symbolic places in modern China. After passing the Meridian Gate, you enter the main courtyard of the Forbidden City, a vast open space that offers a breathtaking view of the surrounding palaces and pavilions.
Among the highlights of the visit are the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the Central Harmony Hall and the Hall of the Preservation of Harmony. These rooms were used for important ceremonies and for the imperial administration. The interiors are richly decorated with golden thrones, murals, sculptures and other artifacts that testify to the opulence of the imperial court.
The Forbidden City is also home to beautiful gardens and pavilions that offer a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. The Imperial Garden, located in the northern part of the complex, is an oasis of peace with exotic plants, centuries-old trees, ponds and artificial rocks. The pavilions and pergolas are decorated with intricate works of art and offer shaded corners where you can relax and admire the landscape.
The visit to the Forbidden City is a journey through time that allows you to immerse yourself in the life and traditions of the Chinese imperial court. The atmosphere is solemn and majestic, and every corner of the complex tells a story of power, art and culture. Audio guides and tourist guides offer detailed explanations that enrich the experience and help you better understand the historical significance of each building and artifact.
The staff of the Forbidden City is courteous and helpful, always ready to assist visitors. The organization is efficient and guarantees a pleasant and smooth visit. The facilities are well maintained and the area is clean and welcoming.
A visit to the Forbidden City of Beijing is an unforgettable experience that offers a deep understanding of Chinese history and culture.

One of the best parts is the open and free spaces where you can interact with kangaroos, feed them, and take great photos. It’s a hands-on, enjoyable experience that feels more personal than a regular zoo visit.

There’s a caf? on-site, and they also allow you to bring your own food. With plenty of picnic tables, it’s perfect for a relaxed outdoor meal with the family.

It’s slightly on the expensive side, especially for larger families, but considering the unique experience and well-maintained facilities, it’s definitely worth it for a special outing.

Our visit to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was deeply enriching and unforgettable. As the largest and oldest koala sanctuary in the world, Lone Pine is a must-visit for anyone passionate about wildlife, conservation, and learning more about these beautiful Australian creatures. With over 100 koalas and a wide range of other native animals, this sanctuary is a true gem just outside of Brisbane.

Our Koala Encounter
We had the pleasure of participating in a very informative and respectful koala experience led by Nadia, our exceptional guide. She took the time to walk us through the types of eucalyptus leaves, letting us smell and compare the different flavors the koalas prefer. We were fascinated to learn how eucalyptus is harvested and sorted to match the koalas’ diets and moods. Nadia also explained the crucial role of bats, especially flying foxes, in transporting the pollen of eucalyptus blossoms from tree to tree by drinking their nectar ? something most people overlook but is essential to koala habitat sustainability.

During our session, we met Spike and Ranger, two absolutely charming koalas we were able to observe closely. Though you don't hold or pet the koalas in this encounter, standing beside them and witnessing their behavior is already an incredible privilege. Later, we had a photo session with Mallon, guided by his dedicated keeper Erin, with Nadia supporting us throughout the experience. The love and care from the staff toward the animals were evident in every step.

It’s important to highlight: these are wild animals, not pets. Interactions are respectful, ethical, and in line with the animals’ comfort. Even though they’re soft and adorable, the experience is focused on learning, understanding, and appreciating them without needing physical contact ? and that’s exactly how it should be.

Wildlife Beyond Koalas
Lone Pine is home to many other native animals, and the sanctuary is much larger than we expected! Some of the highlights include:

A large kangaroo reserve where you can walk among and feed the roos

Emus, wombats, dingoes, and even a platypus enclosure

Reptile and bird sections, including parrots, cockatoos, and birds of prey

A bat aviary, which connects perfectly to the pollination theme we learned about

Several educational shows and keeper talks throughout the day

Every enclosure is spacious and well-maintained, with plenty of information provided both through signage and the knowledgeable staff.

Practical Info & Recommendations

Our guided tour and animal encounter lasted about 3 hours, but you can easily spend a full day exploring everything the sanctuary has to offer.

There's a caf? and gift shop on-site with snacks, souvenirs, and great koala-themed merchandise.

Paths are accessible and well-marked ? suitable for families, couples, or solo travelers.

We recommend arriving early to get the most out of your day, and if you're booking any encounters or photo sessions, reserve them online in advance as they fill up quickly!

Final Thoughts
Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is more than a tourist stop ? it’s a sanctuary in the true sense of the word, dedicated to conservation, education, and the respectful treatment of native Australian wildlife. We left inspired, better informed, and with memories that will stay with us forever.

Thank you, Lone Pine, and special thanks to Nadia and Erin for making our visit so meaningful. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Brisbane!

The interior is just as impressive as the exterior. Every room is decorated with luxurious materials?marble floors, gold accents, and massive crystal chandeliers. During the tour, I got to see the Honor Hall, the Music Hall, and even the largest ballroom in Europe. The Pink Room, with its elegant design, was definitely a highlight.

The tour guide was knowledgeable and engaging, sharing fascinating details about the history and construction of the palace. However, security measures are quite strict, and there was a bit of a wait before the tour started, so it’s good to be prepared for that.

Inside, the frescoes were restored using a special technique that brought the original colors back, even though they are not so vivid and some small details (like the faces and hands of some saints) were lost in the process. Few people know that next to the altar, there is a small square that has been left unrestored, just to see how black the walls used to be before rehabilitation.

The basilica's sheer size and beauty make it a must-visit attraction in Budapest.

Located right in the heart of downtown Cebu City, near the Basilica Minore del Santo Ni?o, this spot is a must-visit if you’re exploring the city for the first time.

The cross is said to have been planted by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, marking the arrival of Christianity in the Philippines. The original cross is believed to be inside the wooden cross you see inside the small octagonal chapel, built to protect it from damage and people chipping it for souvenirs.

When you arrive, you’ll see the chapel standing in an open plaza. The ceiling is painted with beautiful artwork showing the first baptism and conversion of early Filipinos to Christianity. It’s a small space, but very meaningful. Locals and tourists alike come here to light candles, say a prayer, or simply take photos and reflect.

You may also encounter vendors outside selling candles, and some even offer to dance while praying for your intentions. While this is part of the local tradition, it’s totally optional.

What I liked:
Rich historical and religious significance
Beautiful painting on the ceiling
Clean and well-maintained area
Close to other attractions like the Santo Ni?o Church and Fort San Pedro
No entrance fee!

Things to know:
Best to go in the morning or late afternoon (less heat and fewer people)
Be respectful ? it’s a religious site
Watch out for pickpockets in crowded areas nearby
You can buy souvenirs from small vendors around the plaza

Magellan’s Cross is not just a tourist spot ? it’s a symbol of Cebu’s deep cultural and spiritual roots.

I visited TOPS Cebu years ago, back when it was still pretty bare - just a nice viewpoint with a simple setup. So when we decided to drop by again recently, I was honestly surprised at how much it’s changed. The place has undergone a serious upgrade. What used to be a quiet hilltop is now a full-blown destination. They've clearly put a lot of thought into developing it to handle crowds - from the multiple-floor parking building to the facilities, it’s built to welcome thousands of people now.
We wanted to catch the golden-hour but ended up going after dark - it was the only time that worked for us. Even then, the place was packed. Lots of local visitors, and I spotted a few foreign tourists too. There was a young guy busking, playing music and keeping the vibe light and lively, which I appreciated. It’s always nice when places like this have a bit of energy to them.
One of the biggest changes is the five-story structure they built. There’s a small fee to go up, but each level gives you an even better view than the last. By the time you get to the top, the view of Cebu City, the coastline, and Lapu-Lapu is pretty spectacular - even at night.
Food-wise, you won’t go hungry. There are a lot more dining options now, from ground level all the way up. It’s easy to grab a snack or meal while you hang out. They’ve also added some touristy stuff like a telescope at the top, “promise locks” for couples, and other little touches that give people something extra to do.
Just a heads-up - the photos I took were on a regular phone and in low light, so they don’t quite do the view justice. It looks way better in person.
Well, TOPS - or The Circle, as it’s now officially called - is still worth the visit. It was good back then, and it’s nice for what it is now. If you haven’t been in a while, you might be surprised like I was. And if it’s your first time, it’s definitely a solid spot to add to your Cebu itinerary.",positive,0.95,very_high,"viewpoint, upgrade, spectacular, dining options, worth the visit","리뷰는 TOPS Cebu에 대한 긍정적인 경험을 표현하고 있습니다. 예전의 소박한 모습에서 크게 발전된 현재의 모습에 놀라움을 표하며, 시설 개선, 다양한 먹거리, 아름다운 야경 감상 등 긍정적인 변화를 강조합니다. 또한, 방문할 가치가 있다고 추천하고 있습니다.",,Philippines,Cebu,"4,943.7","3,325.4",325,,5.6,,25,0.44,37,325,6

Located just north of the moat, this 14th-century temple boasts a massive, ancient chedi in classic Lanna style, adorned with intricate elephant carvings and weathered stucco details that whisper stories of the past.

The temple’s serene atmosphere is its greatest charm?you can wander the grounds almost alone, admiring the towering chedi, golden Buddha images, and rustic wooden viharn (prayer hall) without the crowds. The giant bodhi tree shading the courtyard adds to the sense of timeless tranquility.

History buffs will love that Wat Lok Moli was once the royal temple of the Mengrai dynasty, and its architecture reflects Chiang Mai’s golden age. The mix of crumbling ancient relics and well-maintained newer structures creates a fascinating contrast.

For a crowd-free, photogenic, and spiritually uplifting temple experience, Wat Lok Moli is a 5-star must-visit. Its off-the-radar location means you can soak in the beauty and history at your own pace.

There were some standout experiences?like the penguin feeding and the chance to step inside a mock aircraft with an old-school video playing inside. Honestly, it’s probably the same video I watched 29 years ago?which gave me a good laugh!

The storm room was fun, with wind chill temperatures dropping to -25°C. That said, there were definitely some underwhelming aspects. The huskies looked completely bored out of their minds, which was quite sad to see. The whole place feels like it’s trying to appeal to everyone?kids, teens, adults, international tourists?but doesn’t quite hit the mark for any particular group. I would never pay full price for this experience. Thankfully, we booked tickets through BookMe, which made it considerably cheaper than purchasing on the day.

A few things to note for families: the layout isn’t stroller-friendly and can feel crammed at times. It’s not the easiest to navigate, especially during busier periods. One recommendation I’d make is to create a designated breastfeeding area. When we asked about family-friendly spaces, we were told to try the private function area upstairs, but mixed communication led to staff questioning our presence there, which was awkward. Also, the baby change room sign says it’s for “disabled people or females with a baby,” which really needs updating for inclusivity.

If you want to soak up the full experience?meaning read every single word on the walls and take in all the exhibits?you’ll want to allow 2?3 hours. I’d recommend arriving early. But for families or casual visitors, you might get through it much faster.

If I’m ever going to return, they’d need to improve the layout, be more inclusive, and cater more clearly to different demographics. If you want children to come and connect with the experience, offer more interactives, find ways to truly engage them, and bring some passion into the storytelling?help them become guardians of tomorrow.

You can spend a lot of time here with the stories to read and narration about the poor women who were accused of witchcraft and tortured and imprisoned.

The park is super easy to get to, it's just a 10-minute walk from the Kutub Minar metro station. The trails and walkways are all really well-maintained and restored, which makes it easy to explore the entire park.

We were excited to see that they're restoring some of the monuments, and they're going to be open to the public soon.

The park is perfect for a day out with family and friends. There are fountains, mountain trails, and plenty of space for kids to run around. Plus, there are some nice resting places where you can relax and enjoy the views.

The only thing I think could be improved is the availability of drinking water facilities. There's only one restroom for the public, so that could also be increased.

A note that backpacks and bags have to be checked into a luggage storage facility (which is free) before entering any of the attractions in this piazza and they do require to see your ticket, this caught some people out on the day of our visit.

The climb was split into multiple sections, with the first being the longest. There are over 400 steps all of which are in a narrow staircase with no room for a hand rail. There is only one staircase for traffic up and down, so at times it can become quite congested especially at the turns on the spiral staircase sections.

After the tour we walked around to explore the Hall of 500s and other rooms further and ended up staring at Dante's death mask - slightly morbid, eerie but beautiful all at the same time.

The only let down was not by the Palazzo but by Headout the tour operator - our tickets were not cheap and included a 3course tuscany lunch at a nearby restaurant but we forgot to ask about it when Daisy left us. So this lunch was not upheld. We had terrible difficulties contacting Headout and finally a week later we received a €42 credit for the 2 lunches which I personally felt was insufficient.

The moment you step into the piazza, you are surrounded by stunning architectural masterpieces, each more impressive than the last. The Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, with its iconic red-tiled dome designed by Brunelleschi, dominates the square and captures your attention instantly. The intricate marble fa?ade and massive scale of the cathedral are simply awe-inspiring.

The Baptistery of San Giovanni and Giotto’s Campanile complete the scene, each offering their own rich history and beautiful details. Everywhere you look, there’s a sense of grandeur and artistry that reflects Florence’s role in the Renaissance.

That said, Piazza del Duomo is extremely popular, and with good reason. It can get very crowded, especially during peak tourist season. Expect to share the space with hundreds of others, and be prepared for long lines if you plan to go inside the cathedral, climb the dome, or visit the bell tower. Booking tickets in advance is highly recommended to make the most of your time.

Despite the crowds, the atmosphere is lively and full of energy. Street performers often add to the vibrancy, and the surrounding caf?s and gelaterias provide perfect spots to sit back and soak in the view.

Overall, Piazza del Duomo is an absolute must-see when in Florence. The beauty, history, and artistry all around you make it an unforgettable experience. Even if you spend just a few hours here, the images of the stunning architecture and lively atmosphere will stay with you forever.

Ponte Vecchio is a medieval stone bridge over the Arno River in Florence. It was the only bridge in Florence to be spared from destruction during World War II. It’s particularly known for the shops built along it, this used to be common practice. The shops were initially butchers, tanners and the like. Now it’s shops like jewellers, art dealers and souvenir shops.
The bridge used to play a vital role in the road system but now it’s closed to vehicular traffic. Nowadays, the bridge is used for heavy foot traffic both because of its popularity and because it connects places of high tourist interest.
The bridge spans the Arvo River at its narrowest point, it first appears in a document in the year 996AD and was destroyed by a flood in 1117AD and reconstructed in stone. This location marks one of the earliest crossings of the Arno River in Florence, possibly originated from Roman times or even before. Although floods have repeatedly damaged it,  the current bridge has stood since approximately 1339-1345.
The Ponte Vecchio is a gorgeous bridge with brilliant views from both directions. It’s extremely busy with tourists and can be very crowded. Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings. Crowds bring pickpockets. The architecture and design is really unique and lovely. It’s really difficult from other any other bridge I have seen. The shops are mainly jewellery shops. Be aware of people coming up to you to see trinkets. Hard to get rid of them.

The sky was clear, the breeze was cool, and the park was filled with families and couples enjoying the beautiful afternoon.

I originally wanted to go up to the top of the monument, but unfortunately, the top floor only opens after 6 PM. Before that, visitors can only go up to the middle observation deck.

To enter Monas, you need to find the underground entrance, which is located across from the exit. (It’s a bit confusing at first!)
Once you go down, there’s a ticket counter where you can choose between two types of tickets.
We chose the ticket for the middle deck, which cost 80,000 IDR per person.

The inside wasn’t in perfect condition ? it felt like they were a little short-staffed, and the facilities could have been better maintained.
Still, the staff were very friendly and welcoming, which made a big difference.

The highlight was definitely the sunset.
There was a live outdoor performance happening near the monument, and as the sun started to set, Monas was bathed in golden light. It was absolutely stunning.

If I could suggest one thing, it would be to add bigger signs for the entrances and exits ? it would make the experience much smoother, especially for first-time visitors.

Walking along the wooden walkways allows you to immerse yourself in the natural beauty of this ecosystem and observe wildlife in its natural habitat.

Problem with cleanliness

Unfortunately, despite its charm, the park is struggling with the problem of pollution. Rubbish, which is brought by the sea during high tides, often remains in the park and is not regularly cleaned. This means that a place that could be a real paradise for nature lovers loses some of its charm.

Is it worth visiting?

Despite these inconveniences, the park is still a pleasant escape from the heat and hustle and bustle of the city. A walk among the mangroves provides a moment of respite and allows you to appreciate the uniqueness of this ecosystem.

So, I just went in anyway. Even after I finished walking around and returned to the counter, there was still no one there.

The place is nice enough?not sure what more you’d expect from a mangrove forest. Some parts are unkempt, though: the signs look moldy and worn, and trash (bottles, worn sandals, plastic bags) was scattered around the forest?probably brought in by flooding. Even the boardwalks felt sketchy, like they could give way at any moment. There’s an observation deck as well, but the trees have overgrown it, so you can't really see much from the top. Fortunately, I did see a few birds, but most were probably scared off by visitors. The forest is also surrounded by housing areas, a golf range, and a sports centre, so it’s not particularly inviting for birds or other wildlife. You are likely to find tree climbing crabs everywhere in the forest though.

The whole walk likely takes about an hour?or more if you’re stopping to watch birds and the like.

I could accept this costs if you'd feel you are helping to maintain this part of the mangrove. But the path is terribly maintained and there's a lot of plastic in the mangrove.

I understand they do their best to filter the garbage out of the river coming from the illegal housing. But there's still so much rubbish in the mangrove itself that I don't understand why a staffmember wouldn't remove it. Especially with tourists paying that much. It's also weird to read about how to take care of the environment, but they don't remove the trash here.

Also, you have to rent binoculars or rubber boots! This should be included in the high entrance fee if someone wishes to use them.

So, the mangrove was very disappointing. Not because of the mangrove forest itself, because it's exactly like a mangrove should be. But because of the rubbish, bad condition of the boardwalk and the high fee. So, it's absolutely not worth your money.

We bought the aquarium & cable car combo ticket for approx. €29/ person, which, in my opinion, was totally value for money!
First of all, I loved the atmosphere surrounding the aquarium as it gave us a happy holiday vibe before we even got in. The aquarium itself was huge & the main entrance was on the 1st floor across a bridge. The layout, the passage & the design of the aquarium were truly amazing.
Inside, there were so many creatures... such as the 10 different types of sharks, various types of rays, many different aquarium fishes (such as clown fish & surgeonfish), jellyfish...etc. and they also have the safe heavens for sea otters & penguins too!
What I also loved about this aquarium was the enormous size of its sealife tank! It has many different viewing points around the tank that split on different floors to enable everyone to enjoy the view of the tank at different angles!
In my opinion, the only rooms for improvement would be the turtles as we couldn't find them anywhere, plus some spots inside the aquarium were a bit overcrowded.

Visiting SEA LIFE London Aquarium was a truly magical experience. Nestled right by the Thames near the London Eye, the location is perfect for combining a relaxing riverside walk with an underwater adventure.
From the moment you enter, the design and layout immerse you in the world of marine life. The Ocean Tunnel was a standout?walking beneath sharks and rays gliding overhead felt surreal. The penguin enclosure was another highlight, especially watching them interact and waddle about playfully.
The variety of sea creatures was impressive?from jellyfish and turtles to piranhas and even crocodiles in the Rainforest Adventure. Everything was well-labelled, educational, and thoughtfully arranged. Kids will love the interactive zones, and adults will appreciate the calm atmosphere and beauty.
Booking online was easy and saved us money. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable, always happy to answer questions. It’s clear they care deeply about conservation, which adds meaning to the visit.

The moment you step inside, you're transported into an incredible underwater world filled with tanks of weird and wonderful marine creatures. Each exhibit comes with fascinating fact files, making the experience both entertaining and educational.

With 14 different rooms and zones housing over 6,000 creatures, there's something amazing to discover around every corner.

The penguin enclosure is particularly special, featuring a clever dome viewing area where you can pop your head in for an up-close view of these adorable creatures. Some of the more curious penguins might even waddle over to investigate their visitors!

One of the absolute highlights is walking over the glass floor with sharks swimming directly beneath your feet! The aquarium houses 500 different species, including an impressive Open Oceans tank featuring the UK's largest living coral reef, and a fantastic Polar Adventure zone.

The 750,000-liter Open Ocean tank is truly breathtaking, home to Southern Stingrays, Cownose Rays, and a variety of tropical fish. You'll also spot impressive creatures like zebra sharks and massive green sea turtles gliding gracefully through the water.

The coral reef section is a particular delight, featuring countless clownfish (perfect for Finding Nemo fans!) darting among their anemone homes, alongside yellow tangs, blue regal tangs, and cardinal fish. The corals themselves create a vibrant underwater garden with their various shapes and colors, from delicate fronds to brain corals.

The jellyfish exhibition is absolutely mesmerizing, featuring the world's largest jellyfish experience. Watching moon jellyfish, white spotted jellyfish, and various sea nettles pulse rhythmically through their tanks is almost hypnotic.

For those seeking an even more immersive experience, the aquarium offers special VIP experiences where you can snorkel with sharks or help feed the penguins alongside the keepers.

What makes this experience even more meaningful is SEA LIFE's commitment to conservation work worldwide, dedicated to protecting marine life and coral reefs. Your visit helps support these important initiatives.

While tickets can be pricey when purchased individually, there are excellent combination ticket options available that can significantly reduce the cost. The experience is particularly perfect for a rainy day activity, and when combined with other nearby attractions, it makes for an unforgettable day out in London. You can spread your visits across 90 days, making it excellent value for money and allowing you to create multiple memorable experiences.

I do feel there was not as much history involved in the first half as I would have liked, it seemed more like it was gearing up for the scare attraction instead.
At first I wasn’t aware the London tombs was a scare attraction I just thought it was an experience costume version of the museum (didn’t read the website properly). However, the scare attraction was VERY good and all actors were great. No pictures allowed (sadly, the set design and the atmosphere was incredible! I wish I had pics to commemorate but it did make everyone more engaged).

At the start of the experience they do take some pictures of your group that you can buy at the end (?15 each). We were in a group of around 15-20 people which I felt was too many for the scare attraction as you have to move as a group. Anyone in the middle to back doesn’t really get much of the scare as you know it’s coming. It would have been better sending a few at a time through and waiting, but the scare bit was a good length for the cost of the experience.

At the end, there is a tiny gift shop and it exits into a bar/pub if you fancy food and a drink.

I loved the scare maze part too, be warned, it's probably not for younger children (it would be too much for my 12 year old but perhaps not other 12 year olds), there are a LOT of jump scares, it's very dark, it's cramped but we had a scream of a time! I would say perhaps a little less on the strobe light area as it's so disorientating.

A particular actor in the street after the experience made my day as he spent a long time telling us the history of London Bridge and even managed to get us a guide which he said was rare.

There are toilets, a bar and food available. We didn't eat but the food did look good and I saw that there was a pool table, darts area and an axe throwing section which was unfortunately closed. Would be great to hang out here after if you drink.

Its cool that you can get your photo taken here before the experience by none other than Jack the Ripper!

Right from the beginning, the dark entrance, spooky lighting, and eerie music set the mood. It’s not a typical museum ? it’s a live-action experience with actors, special effects, and interactive storytelling. Each room takes you into a different part of London’s dark history ? from the Plague to Jack the Ripper, and even a courtroom where you might be “punished” for crimes!

The actors are brilliant ? they mix fear with humour so well that you’ll be both laughing and shivering. There are sudden jump scares, clever jokes, and even a drop ride at the end that gave me actual butterflies!

It reminded me of our haunted house rides at Indian fairs ? but much more high-tech and history-based. I wouldn’t recommend it for very young kids, but for teenagers and adults, it’s a perfect mix of learning and entertainment.

Without the pass, tickets for two adults and two kids can be around ?140, so the pass makes a big difference. Just a heads-up: try to go on a clear day ? the view really depends on the weather, and you want to make the most of it.

The whole experience blew me away. The elevator ride to the top was insanely fast ? before you even realize it, you’re looking out across the entire city. Once you reach the main level, there are actually three more floors to explore. The very top is an open-air space, and you can feel the fresh air rushing in as you take in those breathtaking views.

There are bars on each level if you fancy a drink with your view ? and trust me, sipping something while London stretches out below you is a moment you won’t forget. It’s wild seeing places like the London Eye look so tiny from up there ? it really gives you a whole new perspective on the city.

I was also pleasantly surprised by the price of the gelato at the top ? three scoops for ?7! That’s actually cheaper than the ice cream we got from a street truck earlier, and way better in taste and texture. Creamy, rich, and just what we needed after taking in the view.

In short: totally worth it. Make sure the weather’s on your side, grab your London Pass, and go soak in that view.

The Tower of London is one of the most iconic and historically rich landmarks in the UK ? a must-visit for anyone traveling to London. From tales of royal betrayals and legendary prisoners to ancient fortifications and priceless treasures, every corner of the Tower echoes with history.

The highlight for many (including me) is the Crown Jewels exhibit ? and it truly lives up to the hype! Seeing the Kohinoor diamond and pieces from the Cullinan diamond up close is both mesmerizing and surreal. The sheer size, brilliance, and craftsmanship of these jewels are jaw-dropping. These gems are not just royal treasures but powerful symbols of history, empire, and controversy, adding an extra layer of intrigue to the experience.

The Yeoman Warder tours (led by the famous Beefeaters) are equally captivating ? a perfect mix of history, humor, and a few spine-chilling tales from the Tower’s darker days. Be sure to explore the Bloody Tower, the Traitor’s Gate, and meet the legendary ravens!

The Tower is very well maintained, well signposted, and family-friendly. Arrive early to beat the queues and take your time soaking in the grandeur and gravity of it all.

The Hollywood Sign ? iconic, world-famous, and still full of surprises. Most people settle for a distant photo… but here’s how you can get up close, from behind, and with the best views in L.A.

I started my hike at the Griffith Observatory, taking the Mount Chapel Trail through the Hollywood Hills. It’s not the only way to reach the sign, but it’s honestly one of the most rewarding ? less crowded, more nature, and breathtaking views all along the way.

And then comes the real magic:
You reach a spot right behind the Hollywood Sign, about 20 meters away from those legendary white letters. And in front of you? A jaw-dropping panorama over Los Angeles ? from downtown to the ocean (on a clear day). It’s the kind of moment that makes you stop, breathe, and smile.

Pro tip: Have your smartphone ready ? this spot delivers movie-worthy shots that’ll light up your social feed. Sunset? Pure gold.
Also: wear good shoes, bring water, and try to go early morning or late afternoon for the best light and fewer people.

Street performers and vendors were just setting up, so the experience felt authentic and relaxed without the usual crowd hustle. The combination of early sunlight, iconic surroundings, and the quiet hum of the city made it a memorable visit.

We went along to see a silent movie screening accompanied by a live quartet, one of the many events that take place as part of Fed Square’s free summer program.

The experience was fantastic. The live band performed on the main stage while classic silent films played overhead on the big screen. They didn’t just play music, the musicians also added in sound effects which brought the films to life in a really fun and engaging way. The crowd was huge, with people filling most of the square. There were plenty of deck chairs provided, but we grabbed a spot on the stairs, which still gave us a good view (even if slightly obstructed). The whole area was super accessible, with lots of open space and dedicated wheelchair accessible areas.

One of the best things about Federation Square is how regularly it hosts free public events. You can find details of what’s on via their website, which is constantly updated with live music, film nights, cultural events and more. Over the summer, I caught a few performances and was always impressed by the variety and the quality of entertainment on offer.

Located within the stunning Bosque de Chapultepec, the Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a is one of the most impressive museums I’ve visited in Latin America. The building itself is massive and beautifully designed, housing an extraordinary collection that spans Mexico’s rich pre-Hispanic history.

I visited on a Sunday, and I strongly recommend arriving early if you plan to go that day?especially since admission is free for nationals, making it one of the busiest days. I arrived shortly after opening and only waited about 10 minutes in line. However, by the time I left, the line had grown significantly, likely with quite a bit of waiting time.

If you want to read the displays, absorb the information, and truly enjoy the full experience, be prepared to spend several hours here. Rushing through would not do justice to the magnitude and quality of the exhibits.

Although I didn’t eat there, the museum also has a restaurant on-site, which looked modern and inviting?definitely a convenient option if you plan to stay for a few hours.

The only thing I didn't like was that you needed to move from one place to another to see the shows. It will be best if they make it in some kind of circle order. It was just too much back and forward. Other than that it is a good place to go and enjoy a good time with family washing the sea lion and dolphin shows.

I was really impressed by how open and natural the environment felt. The habitats are beautifully designed to mimic real ecosystems, and what really stood out to me was how free the animals were to move around. There were very few cages or obvious barriers, which made it feel more immersive and respectful of the animals’ space.

Walking through each zone, from the tropical rainforest to the Laurentian maple forest, felt like stepping into a completely different part of the world. You could hear the birds, feel the changes in temperature and humidity, and really get a sense of how these ecosystems function. It’s a great place for all ages and super educational without feeling like a traditional museum or zoo.

The only small downside was that some of the animals were resting in the cozy little shelters designed for them, so in a few cases, you couldn’t see what they were. I also noticed there weren’t many signs identifying the animals, which made it a bit hard to know exactly what you were looking at. But overall, that didn’t take away from how unique and memorable the visit was.

We just explored the routes, essentially if you keep heading upwards you won’t go far wrong. Once at the top there are several different areas, some open spaces, a couple of food stalls, a toilet (0.5 Euros), some amazing vantage points, a performance area and of course the famous waterfall.

Visiting Colline de Ch?teau was one of the highlights of our trip to Nice! The views from the top are absolutely breathtaking, especially as you gaze down at the iconic Promenade des Anglais stretching into the distance, framed by the stunning Mediterranean Sea.

There’s so much to explore here, from ancient ruins that whisper tales of history to a delightful kids' playground that adds a fun element for families. We enjoyed a lovely picnic while soaking in the beautiful scenery, and it was a perfect spot to relax. The two snack bars on-site provided a nice selection of refreshments, and I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the public toilet, which only costs 0.50 euros.

Accessing the summit is easy, with options for everyone. We decided to take the scenic route and hiked up the gradual incline at the back, which was a lovely experience, especially given the larger crowd due to the Easter holiday. For those who prefer a quicker ascent, there’s also a free elevator available.

Visiting the Fram Museum was like stepping into a real-life adventure story...  one filled with courage, resilience, and extreme conditions. The museum is dedicated to Norway's legendary polar expeditions, and it does an outstanding job of immersing visitors in the world of Arctic and Antarctic exploration.

The highlight, of course, is the Fram ship itself ? the actual vessel used by pioneers like Fridtjof Nansen, Otto Sverdrup, and Roald Amundsen. It's not just on display ? you can go aboard and explore inside, seeing the original cabins, equipment, and even personal belongings of the crew. It’s fascinating to imagine what life must have been like in such brutal, icy conditions.

The museum combines interactive exhibits, historical film footage, and well-documented storytelling to bring the era to life. There’s even a cold room simulation, where you can feel the chill of the polar winds ? a small but powerful touch that makes the experience feel even more real.

What I appreciated most was how the museum doesn't just glorify the success of these expeditions ? it also highlights the scientific contributions, the hardships, and the human side of exploration. It’s a place that both adults and children can enjoy, offering a mix of education, adventure, and awe.

The Eiffel Tower (Tour Eiffel), one of the most recognizable and iconic monuments in the world, dominates the Paris skyline, captivating millions of visitors each year. Constructed by Gustave Eiffel and his company for the 1889 World's Fair, it marked the centennial of the French Revolution. Originally intended as a temporary structure, its utility as a radio and television antenna saved it and established it as a lasting symbol of France and industrial progress.

Its construction, which lasted just over two years, two months, and five days, was a technological marvel for its time, utilizing prefabricated iron elements assembled with impressive precision. Despite initial opposition from artists and intellectuals of the era, the Eiffel Tower quickly became a beloved symbol.

Today, a visit to the Eiffel Tower is an experience that combines historical significance with a unique atmosphere. Ascending its various levels, visitors are treated to breathtaking panoramic views of the entire city of Paris. The sense of history is palpable in every metal beam, recalling the era of its construction and the generations who have admired this magnificent feat of engineering.

During the day, the tower buzzes with life, as thousands of tourists explore its levels and take in the sights. However, as night falls, a different, more serene atmosphere envelops the structure. The tower's illumination, especially the dazzling display of twinkling lights that occurs every hour, creates a magical and romantic ambiance. Whether observing the lit tower from afar or enjoying the view of the illuminated city from its summit, visitors feel a profound connection to the beauty and history of Paris.

The shop was interesting, you could go crazy if you had the money .  The museum was full of great artifacts. I found it so fascinating. I loved that you get the $2 mint your own medallion with the tour ticket.
The Tour costs are -
Adult $25.00
Child (5-15 years) $15.00
Concession $22.00
The Perth Mint is Australia’s official bullion mint and owned wholly by the Government of Western Australia. It was established on 20th June 1899. Along with the Royal Australian Mint, the Perth Mint is the oldest of Australia’s two mints that is producing coins that are legal tender. The Perth Mint initially served two purposes, one to produce coins for circulation in Western Australia. Secondly, the mint bought the vast majority of the gold mined in Western Australia, which at the time was done mainly by “diggers” who had migrated to WA from other states and also from other countries.
Even though Western Australia took part in the Federation of the Australian Colonies in 1901, Perth Mint remained under the control of the UK government until 1st July 1970 when ownership was transferred to the government of Western Australia.

You either marvel at its raw beauty and echoes of ancient history, or you see nothing but a brutalist behemoth: cold, unyielding concrete cloaked in irreverence and incompletion.

Either way, no one can deny the bravado of the architect Edgar de Oliveira da Fonseca. Perhaps his wish to break away from the “European Tradition” is most compelling - instead of copying European Gothic or Baroque styles (as many New World cathedrals did), Fonseca wanted a modern, Latin American identity. Referencing the indigenous cultures of the Americas created a more regionally authentic, contextually relevant and unique expression of faith.

We were awestruck by the spatial drama, tactile richness, and muscular elegance of the interior - a space that demands recognition and reverence. The stained glass panels are a triumph: rigorously modern, boldly expressive, and soaring in scale. Their crescendo, a Grecian cross suspended at the apex, feels less like decoration and more like a modern masterpiece - worthy of a place in any major art museum.

The architecture is stunning, and the composition is beautifully executed. Honestly, just visiting the site to take photos both outside and inside would have been worth it, as you’re allowed entry up to a certain point without a ticket.

I purchased a ticket for the Cosmos e Sonhos exhibition, and unfortunately, it was completely underwhelming. There was nothing surprising or thought-provoking about it. The exhibition consisted mostly of text and photos without much artistic composition or a deeper perspective to make it engaging. Even the ""interactive"" sections were essentially just more text. There were also some quizzes to determine what kind of human you are, your impact on global destruction, and similar themes?basic stuff, almost like BuzzFeed-style personality tests.

Each time I an in Roma I pass here & will visit the Pantheon. This is by far my FAVORITE building in the world. I am a bit of a history buff, so for me this is THE most important architectural building in the world.
I love everything from it. Here the Romans did not really invent this style of column building, it already existed with the Greeks. The point is they really perfected it. Everything is special, they managed to do this facade with eight columns, three level of depth, all of them massive colonnade and weight, they also had to think really hard to come up with the emptiness of the top squares which you can see from inside, in order to lower the total weight of the rotunda. They also invented a new type of cement using sea water (found 80km away), volcanic ashes (coming from 250km away) pouzzolane, realizing that mixing this would make this concrete stronger over time.
One of the few building in Europe that are 2000 years old, still standing tall & still being used. The sheer size of it in also incredible, this is massive and the coupole is extraordinary to have been built 2 millenium ago without modern machinery.
Last but not least I also love the fact the name on the building is not the name of the emperor who finished it but the one who started it. This was rare in those days for a man (be it an emperor) to show so much humility and respect for his predecessors.

As an annual pass holder, I visit often?but this show is easily one of the most intimate and moving exhibitions I’ve experienced in years.

These photographs, taken by Paul himself, chronicle the band’s meteoric rise from late 1963 through their first tour of the U.S. in early 1964. What makes it so special isn’t just the historical weight?it’s how raw and personal the images feel. From candid shots backstage and in hotel rooms to moments of quiet reflection between John, George, and Ringo, McCartney captures a whirlwind from the inside, at the eye of the storm.

It’s rare to see Beatlemania through the Beatles’ own lens. And what’s astonishing is how sharp Paul’s composition is?his use of light, motion, and framing rivals many professional photographers. The show is organized chronologically by city?Liverpool, Paris, New York, D.C., Miami?and supported with engaging context that brings the era to life.

Major props to the de Young for their presentation: the layout flows well, the lighting is respectful of these aged prints, and the optional audio guide adds depth without distraction. I’d recommend weekday visits to avoid the crowds.

If you’re remotely interested in pop culture, photography, or 1960s history, don’t miss this one.

What really stood out to me was how beautifully the birds and nature seem to live in harmony with the visitors. There’s a sense of calm here that makes you feel completely at ease, as if the space was designed for relaxation and connection with the environment. From the Palm Grove with its towering palms to the vibrant seasonal displays at The Calyx, each section of the garden offers something special. I also loved the Rose Garden during spring ? it was simply breathtaking.

The Bennelong Precinct, with its gorgeous views of the harbour, is another highlight. This place is a perfect spot for a peaceful stroll, a picnic, or just a moment of reflection. It reminds me a bit of Central Park in New York, where the city’s energy mixes beautifully with the surrounding nature.

With a hold pass you get to go on their train rides around the zoo. Train ride is good especially when you visit during bad weather or if you’re tired walking back from Africa or if you want to quickly get to Canadian domain.

There are always some Renos going on. So getting to Canadian domain is only possible through Africa.

If you have membership I’d suggest visiting at different times of the day. Evenings are good cause most people are tired and are leaving by then.

Interesting stuff to watch: feeding lions, bear and wolves, kangaroo walk (only open in certain days in summer)

Best part to catch the train: section after Africa cause you pass through gated areas with Mongolian horses and Yaks which you can’t see otherwise. So it’s a good value added. Tip: when there is too many people in line in African walk towards the previous stop at Canadian domain and catch the train before it gets to Africa.

If you had young kids, stroller is highly recommended as there is a lot of walking needed. The entire zoo is wheelchair accessible. You can also rent them in the entrance (stroller/wagon, both are available).

You can pack your own food and enjoy them in picnic spots which have lot of tables and benches. There are also food options available inside from pizza to poutine to juices. There are also drinking water stations available widely.

You might get disappointed or lucky when it comes to watching animals like lion, tiger etc. They sometimes hide inside or sleep. But animals like monkey, zebra, giraffe could be spotted mostly. There are also aquatic animals like fish, penguins etc.

Washrooms are widely available inside which are surprisingly very neat - we used in 3 places. All have change stations as well, if you have diaper babies.

Plan to spend at least 6-7 hours if you want a relaxed trip and also want to cover the entire zoo.

Designed by Antonio Contino in the 17th century, its delicate white limestone fa?ade and intricate carvings add to its romantic yet melancholic allure.

You get a card - which is gives you a persona and a mission.  There are computer kiosks throughout the museum that you check-in with and it unravels a story and missions.  Great for kids.

The museum itself was fascinating.  Goes through all the branches of spying and gives examples of each function.  You see a lot of it in Hollywood, but to break down the field into the core functions and present the tools of the trade as well as the history is just tremendously educational and fun at the same time.

Of particular interest to me - because I heard about the story in my youth - was Robert Hanssen.  This was an American FBI agent who committed treason and sold his country for what I would consider peanuts.  This museum had his personal effects like his Rolex as well as the Palm Pilot that he used to store the information to evade people trying to catch him.

?? History and Transformation: In 2004, the U.S. General Services Administration awarded the property to Forest City Washington, Inc. for redevelopment. Now, the site hosts 2,800 new residential units and 200,000 square meters of office and retail space. ????

?? Location: Yards Park is situated in the Navy Yard neighborhood, west of the historic Washington Navy Yard and east of Nationals Park. It is accessible by the Navy Yard ? Ballpark station on the Green Line of the Washington Metro. ??

?? Park Highlights: The park offers a variety of green spaces, walking trails, event spaces, and stunning views of the Anacostia River. It's a perfect spot to relax, have a picnic, or simply enjoy the beauty of nature in the city.

? Tips for Visiting:
- Bring your camera to capture the spectacular views.
